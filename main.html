	 <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I was immediately inspired by the women around me. They were all so creative, smart, and brave. However, due to my low self-esteem, 
		I felt I was neither creative nor smart enough.
        Since I could not stop dreaming of becoming one of these women, I signed up for a course with “Tjejer kodar” held at the Swedish island Gotland.
		This time with an introduction to JavaScript.</p>
